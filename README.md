# Hard-coded-regularized-PCA
Machine learning class final project. The PCA code implements regularized PCA with gradient descent as the parameter estimation method (PCA algorithm only utilizes no python libraries aside from numpy). DISCLAIMER: I am not a computer science student (self-thought), so I realize that much of the code is probably not as optimized  as it could be.
